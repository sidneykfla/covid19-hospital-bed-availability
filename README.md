### Description
For our hackathon project, we decided to create user-friendly visualizations for COVID-19-related hospital bed availability data. We collected data using the COVID Act Now API and created visualizations using Microsoft's Power BI platform. Furthermore, we sketched out a skeleton website for what a bare-bones data presentation static HTML page might look like. Our end-products are the Power BI visualizations we created.

### Data Sources
- COVID Act Now
- National, state, and county level data analysis
- Free API

### Microsoft Power BI Visualizations

### Hosting Static HTML Pages on GitHub Pages
While we don't have a live demo of a static webpage, creating one is simple. All we have to do is create a new 'gh-pages' branch in our host repository and add the HTML/CSS/JS files to that branch. Once we do that, GitHub automatically recognizes the branch and hosts the static webpage for free.
